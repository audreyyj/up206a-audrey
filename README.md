### Hello, world.
#### I'm Audrey Younsook Jang.
I am a first year urban planning and law dual degree student. 
I have several ideas for my data science project:
* Explore Los Angeles County multifamily property values and rents, particularly around planned transit sites to evaluate risk for gentrification. 
* Comparing the planned subway expansion in Los Angeles County to the existing subway infrastructure in Seoul, South Korea 
* Identifying sites for renewable energy infrastructure, on the Southern CA, CA, or national scale. 

I took a couple Esri-based GIS courses in undergrad, and was strongly drawn to the coding- and open-source platform-based nature of this course. 
I hope to develop a personal process for generating exploratory maps efficiently.
