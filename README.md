### Hello, world
#### I'm Audrey Younsook Jang.
I am a first year urban planning and law dual degree student. 
I'm interested in exploring Los Angeles County multifamily property values and rents, particularly around planned transit sites to evaluate risk for gentrification. 
I am also interested in a project related to renewable energy, on the Southern CA, CA, or national scale. 
I took a couple Esri-based GIS courses in undergrad, and was strongly drawn to the coding- and open-source platform-based nature of this course. 
I hope to develop a personal process for generating exploratory maps efficiently.
