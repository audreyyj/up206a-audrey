These global trends in street-network disconnectedness articulate diverse correlations between wealth and sprawl. I found the commentary on gated communities and their impact on sprawl fascinating, especially in Central America where they are juxtaposed with informal settlements. Such extremes of disinvestment and privilege are familiar, and their impact on the street grid and thus the city’s mobility, flexibility, and sustainability present yet another harm done by economic inequality (I’m reminded of [a meme](https://preview.redd.it/okivrufv24x31.jpg?width=960&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=faebca26902c3d096715f4a9c10f627e0413b2d4) of *Parasite* director Bong Joon Ho). The scariest concept I learned in my undergraduate Introduction to Politics course was that of path dependency; it is overwhelming to read about the increasing disconnectedness of streets around the world, not because of how they look necessarily, but because of what those trends indicate about equity and sustainability. Finally and almost as an aside, I’m interested in reading Professor Millard-Ball’s previous paper that identified street network types, as it would help interpret the street grids Shinah and I are generating for our group project (also, it’s interesting). 


Questions for Prof. Millard Ball: 

1. Have you explored the relationship between SNDi and indices that quantify political climate/structure? 

It makes intuitive sense that middle income countries would adopt car-centric development patterns with economic modernization, and that “highly indebted poor countries” in Africa and the Middle East would see minimal changes in connectivity given relatively lower rates of development. But I wonder if the mixed results seen in low to middle income countries (especially India and China) could be partially explained by an analysis of government structure. 


2. Have you considered policies addressing economic inequality (on city, national, global scales) / how their impacts on street connectivity may be measured? 

Your policy proposals address command and control regulations (e.g. banning gated communities, requiring a minimum level of grid connectivity) and market approaches (e.g. tax on sprawling/arguably less desirable streets, other Pigouvian taxes). What about progressive tax structures, neighborhood revitalization agendas, policies in the New Urbanist tradition that promote housing development near job centers, etc?  

3. What do you think policies that specifically pursue grid connectivity have to offer, and in which scenarios do you think they are most effective? 
Relating to the brief discussion of natural disasters providing opportunities for redesigning street grids, how much does the natural environment of cities impact the development of urban street grids in more everyday, less spectacular ways?
