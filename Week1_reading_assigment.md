# Solving Climate Change with a Loan 
### Saul Griffith 
In [Solving Climate Change with a Loan](https://www.saulgriffith.com/blog/solving-climate-change-with-a-loan), engineer and energy entrepreneur Saul Griffith advocates for a climate loan to scale adoption of electric cars and green home retrofits such as electric home heating and residential rooftop solar.
Given that homes and passenger vehicles emit a bulk of our greenhouse gas emissions, Griffith calls for the electrification of infrastructure on the personal level as well as societal. 
He calls for the development of a low-interest loan product to subsidize upfront capital costs for consumers to decarbonize their choice the next time they buy a new car or fix the roof, not unlike how the invention of the mortgage in the 20th century greatly expanded homeownership in the U.S.
