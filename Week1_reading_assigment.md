# Solving Climate Change with a Loan 
### Saul Griffith 
In [Solving Climate Change with a Loan](https://www.saulgriffith.com/blog/solving-climate-change-with-a-loan), engineer and energy entrepreneur Saul Griffith advocates for a climate loan to scale adoption of electric cars and green home retrofits such as electric home heating and residential rooftop solar.
Given that homes and passenger vehicles emit a bulk of our greenhouse gas emissions, Griffith calls for the electrification of infrastructure on the personal level as well as societal.
