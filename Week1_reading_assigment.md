# Solving Climate Change with a Loan 
### Saul Griffith 
    In [Solving Climate Change with a Loan](https://www.saulgriffith.com/blog/solving-climate-change-with-a-loan), engineer and energy entrepreneur Saul Griffith advocates for a climate loan to scale adoption of electric cars and green home retrofits such as electric home heating and residential rooftop solar. Griffith articulates the climate solution as mass electrification and decarbonization of the grid. Given the upfront capital costs of building renewable energy infrastructure, the interest rate poses the greatest barrier to this transition. Moreover, given that homes and passenger vehicles emit a bulk of our greenhouse gas emissions, Griffith calls for the electrification of infrastructure on the personal level as well as societal. He calls for the development of a low-interest loan product to subsidize upfront  costs for consumers to decarbonize their choice the next time they buy a new car or fix the roof, similarly to how the invention of the mortgage in the 20th century proliferated the construction of (energy-inefficient) single family home-filled suburbs and greatly expanded middle class homeownership. 

I am strongly compelled by Griffithâ€™s comparison of his proposed climate loan to the federal government-backed long-term mortgage. My research interests lie in the intersection of housing and environmental justice -- specifically, how collective housing (community land trusts and cooperatives) can expand access to the climate incentives available to homeowners, thus scaling adoption of zero carbon alternatives. Griffith asserts that the long-run energy cost savings of decarbonization will benefit low-income households. Building on this, I am interested in exploring how the terms of such a loan can be designed to center equity and reparations, providing wealth building opportunities to groups who were systematically excluded from that of the federal mortgages in the post-war era. 

I am interested in learning how to process data to reveal patterns in how we live, how we move, and the aggregate impact of those decisions on our climate and equity goals. I would like to visualize the material energy infrastructure -- "the grid" -- and housing development patterns. Griffith indicates that at a certain point, adding batteries to homes would be more efficient than building large new infrastructure; I would like to develop the ability to evaluate the feasibility of such decentralized implementation of climate initiatives."
