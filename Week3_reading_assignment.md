# Week 3 Assignment: Reading Response 
### "OSMnx: New methods for acquiring, constructing, analyzing, and visualizing complex street networks"
###### Geoff Boeing 

For the purposes of this class, I am quite grateful that Mr. Boeing created this freely available street network analysis tool as it is exactly relevant to our group project research question: What can LA's developing transit system learn from that of Seoul? 
I am especially interested in comparing the non-planar elements of Seoul and Korea; I was deeply impressed by Seoul's use of vertical space in its pedestrian networks, and am very curious how that compares to LAs' (in)famous [freeway stack interchanges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Level_Interchange).
I know nothing about network or graph theory, yet I was able to almost fully understand the terms and concepts laid out in the paper's literature review. 
I imagine the laundry list of measures that one can calculate in OSMnx will be useful to Shinah and my objective of comparing two very different urban areas' transportation network. 
The Python package not only allows a standardized set of functions to compare disparate street networks from radically different contexts, but it also appears to simplify what must have been a gargantuan task of downloading and compiling large datasets.
It strikes me that street networks are almost organic, as they develop in a decentralized manner over time. 
Yet specific socio-politico-economic factors produces very different street networks, and OSMnx allows us to easily explore those differences in a systematic way.
I do think there is always danger of standardized measures missing important nuances, especially if it becomes a tool for policy prescription - for example, I recall learning somewhere that the Haussmanization of Paris (which produced its gridded master-planned streets) were in response to the French Revolution. Griddedness may be associated with better health/livability outcomes, but it could also provide tools to powers that police. 
Yet for analytical purposes, I am in complete awe of this technology, especially as it directly derives from crowdsourced data. 

I was curious, though, how Mr. Boeing defines the "Walk" network type. Would that basically be any street with a sidewalk + pedestrian only streets? Is there a walkability index that can be calcualted?
